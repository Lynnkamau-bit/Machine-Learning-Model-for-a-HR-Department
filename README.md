# Machine-Learning-Model-for-a-HR-Department
This project demonstrates Supervised Machine Learning using Multiple Linear Regression to predict employee salaries based on measurable factors such as work experience, test scores, and interview performance. The model learns from historical data and uses these learned relationships to make predictions on new, unseen data.
The steps involved are as follows:
1.	Input features (experience, test score, interview score) are prepared and cleaned.
2.	The target variable (salary) is separated from the input data to avoid data leakage.
3.	A Linear Regression model is trained (fit) to learn the relationship between inputs and salary.
4.	The trained model can then predict salaries for new candidates based on their scores.
