# Machine-Learning-Model-for-a-HR-Department
This project demonstrates Supervised Machine Learning using Multiple Linear Regression to predict employee salaries based on measurable factors such as work experience, test scores, and interview performance. The model learns from historical data and uses these learned relationships to make predictions on new, unseen data.
